### Co-op Design Manual

When adding elements to the page you should take a look at the [Co-op Design Manual](https://coop-design-manual.herokuapp.com/index.html).

### File structure

Co-op Prototyping folders are in `source/assets ...` and shouldn't be touched.

* Images should be added to `source/images`
* JavaScript to `source/javascripts`
* Additional styles for the prototype to `source/stylesheets`
